API Contract: Device Savings Data API

1. Introduction
The Device Savings Data API provides access to device savings data, including total carbon savings, total fuel savings, monthly averages, and graph data for a specified time interval. The API allows clients to retrieve this data by making HTTP GET requests with the required parameters.

2. Base URL
The base URL for accessing the API is: http://localhost:3000/

3. Endpoint
- Method: GET
- Path: /
- Description: Retrieves device savings data based on the provided parameters.

4. Request Parameters
The following parameters are required in the query string of the GET request:
- id (string): The ID of the device.
- startDate (string): The start date of the time interval in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- endDate (string): The end date of the time interval in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

Example request:
GET /?id=device123&startDate=2023-01-01&endDate=2023-12-31

5. Response
- Content-Type: application/json
- Response Body:
{
  "totalSums": {
    "totalCarbonSavings": number,
    "totalFuelSavings": number
  },
  "cumulativeAverages": {
    "averageCarbon": number,
    "averageFuel": number
